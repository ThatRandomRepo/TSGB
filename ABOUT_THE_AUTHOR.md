# About the Author

I’m Bi Polar.

That’s not a confession — it’s a *feature*, not a bug.  
My thinking is binary. Not grey. Not maybe. Not “sort of.”  
**Yes / No. True / False. Black / White.**  
That thinking led me here — to TSGB — and the pile of documentation you're looking at.

## Why This Matters

My work might seem chaotic.  
But every note, every sim, every test, every wall I bounced off — is part of how we got here.

This isn’t a white paper polished by a university PR team.  
This is a year of obsession, built from scratch, mistakes and all.

- I don’t have formal mechanical or electrical training.  
- I have IT qualifications, sure — but I learned this by *doing*, not reading.  
- The shed was the lab. The grid was the question. The mountain of data was the answer.

## Don’t Feel Sorry For Me

I’m not telling you I’m Bi Polar for pity.  
I’m telling you because **context matters**.

My brain works this way.  
And maybe that’s why this idea came together like it did.

TSGB isn’t just an engineering proposal.  
It’s **how I think** — crystallized into torque, gears, feedback loops, and controlled chaos.

## Read This Work For What It Is

This isn’t academic. This isn’t sanitized.  
It’s jagged, raw, real, and **backed by logic**.

I’ll debate anyone who wants to engage.  
I’ll explain why it works. I’ll admit what’s missing.  
I’ve lived with it long enough to know what it *isn’t*.  
And longer still to know what it *could be*.

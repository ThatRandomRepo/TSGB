# **TwinScroll Grid Balancer (TSGB)**  
### *A Simple, Brutal Answer to the Grid’s Hardest Problem*

---

## **The Problem**
As synchronous generators disappear and inverter-based resources dominate, we’ve lost the physical inertia that kept grids stable for 100 years.  
The result?  
- Higher **RoCoF**  
- Brittle **voltage control**  
- Blackouts when synthetic fixes can’t keep up  

Digital systems *react after the hit*. The grid needs instant muscle.

## **The Solution: TSGB**
A modular mechanical platform that delivers:
- **Real inertia**  
- **Real power**  
- **Fast reactive support**  
All in one box. Off-the-shelf parts, no exotic tech, no fragile software layers.  
**If you need 2 GW in 50 milliseconds, TSGB gives it to you.**

## **Core Capabilities**
- ✅ **Instant Inertia Injection** – Physical rotating mass reacts faster than any inverter  
- ✅ **Continuous Real Power** – DC-fed drive motors pull from HVDC, batteries, solar, or gensets  
- ✅ **Reactive Power on Demand** – Full synchronous VAR support during voltage dips  
- ✅ **Black Start & Grid-Forming** – From zero volts to a stable 50 Hz reference in minutes  
- ✅ **Surge Output** – Massive torque bursts for RoCoF suppression

## **Why It Wins**
- **Multi-Role Asset:** Inertia + active power + VAR + black start  
- **Mechanical Simplicity:** <12 moving parts, minimal maintenance  
- **Modular & Scalable:** Units from **1 MW to 100 MW**  
- **Compact:** A 10 MW TSGB fits in the footprint of a few parking spaces  
- **Physics > Firmware:** No race conditions, no waiting on code

## **What It Delivers**
- ✔ Cuts blackout risk during generator or interconnector trips  
- ✔ Slashes balancing costs (replaces synthetic inertia & fast reserves)  
- ✔ Enables higher renewable penetration without compromising stability  
- ✔ Restores a national grid from black start in **under 6 hours**  
- ✔ Gives wind and solar real inertia and nuclear level punching gloves

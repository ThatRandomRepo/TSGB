# TSGB Solar Case — Midday Spikes Tamed, Clouds Defanged

Solar farms have their own brand of chaos. Clear skies, clouds, passing shadows from a nearby wind farm — PV output can change in seconds. Inverter firmware smooths it as best it can, but the grid still feels the bumps.

## 1. The Problem

PV inverters operate on a knife-edge: maximum power point tracking (MPPT) one second, fault ride-through the next. When cloud edges hit, you get power spikes or sudden drops. Multiply by hundreds of strings, and the substation bus voltage swings like a pendulum.

## 2. The TSGB Solution

Position TSGB units at the PCC or major combiner points:
- **Inertia:** Absorbs and supplies torque instantly to smooth step changes.
- **Voltage support:** Excitation control holds the bus steady during irradiance swings.
- **Anti-hunting:** Torque bias offsets stop inverters from chasing each other’s PLLs.

## 3. Benefits

- **Reduced ramp rates:** Natural smoothing without adding battery or capacitor banks.
- **Grid friendliness:** Operator sees steady power, less chance of curtailment.
- **No extra conversion stage:** TSGB ties directly into the AC side, no double-conversion losses.

## 4. Deployment Strategy

- Size for ~10–15% of farm nameplate capacity.
- Use for inertia, VARs, and ride-through at the PCC.
- Monitor via existing SCADA — just more channels.

## Bottom Line

For solar, the TSGB is the grid-side grown-up in the room. It keeps the output steady, supports voltage, and takes the edge off cloud-induced chaos — all without touching the PV strings or their inverters.

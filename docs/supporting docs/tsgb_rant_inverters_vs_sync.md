# Why Digital Inverters Will Never Compete — A TSGB White Paper Rant

Let’s be blunt: digital inverters are the grid’s weakest link. They are the glossy, overhyped “smart” toys of the renewable industry, and the moment you put them head-to-head against a mechanically coupled synchronous generator like the TSGB, they lose. On *every* metric. At *every* scale.

## 1. **Latency is physics — and you can’t code it away**

The inverter crowd loves to throw around microsecond DSP loop times and nanosecond switching claims, but the reality is ugly: you are still measuring, digitising, computing, and actuating. The grid moves in milliseconds; you’re playing catch-up in discrete steps.  
By the time the inverter “decides” to push harder, the event has already moved on.

A synchronous generator doesn’t “decide” anything — it pushes in real time, in proportion to the disturbance, with **zero delay** because the torque path is steel, not silicon.

## 2. **They fake inertia — and badly**

“Virtual inertia” is the most dishonest phrase in power engineering. You can’t emulate stored kinetic energy with a control loop without the loop becoming the bottleneck.  
- Mechanical inertia reacts instantly to a frequency dip — the shaft just resists slowing.  
- Digital emulation *waits* to see the dip, then spins up semiconductor switches to push current, which is by definition too late.

It’s the difference between a spring that’s already compressed and a motor that only starts turning once you notice you’ve been hit.

## 3. **Ride-through is conditional — and fragile**

Inverter firmware is full of “grid code compliant” boxes to tick: voltage ride-through, frequency ride-through, reactive power on demand. But trip one protection element, or exceed one programmed threshold, and it’s game over — the inverter isolates and the grid gets nothing.  
A synchronous generator will sit in the mud with the grid, still pushing, until the rotor physically stops. There’s no “I saw 47.99 Hz, so I disconnected.”

---

## 4. **Scalability is not your friend**

Every additional MW of inverter capacity means:
- More IGBTs or MOSFETs
- More heat sinks
- More control hardware
- More points of failure

And all of them have to be coordinated in software, which is where timing jitter, network delays, and firmware bugs creep in. A bigger synchronous machine is just… a bigger rotor, bigger bearings, bigger stator. Physics scales cleanly.

---

## 5. **Cost per MW of stability is a joke**

If you measure the cost not just per MW of *energy*, but per MW of *inertial response*, inverters are catastrophic. They have *no real inertia*. You’d have to massively oversize the DC link capacitance and energy storage to even sniff the TSGB’s response, at which point you’ve built a worse, more fragile version of a flywheel.

---

## 6. **Failure modes are abrupt and ugly**

An inverter that fails does so instantly: semiconductor short, control board crash, overvoltage trip — output goes to zero in a heartbeat.  
A synchronous generator failure is a spectrum: it can still coast, still produce, still give you reactive support even with partial mechanical or excitation issues. And when you do shut it down, it’s graceful.

---

## 7. **Thermal limits are unavoidable**

Digital inverters are thermally constrained from the moment you switch them on. Push them hard in hot weather, and junction temps climb until the firmware backs you off — or you blow silicon. The TSGB’s thermal limit is “did you lubricate it and is the oil cooler running?” Bearings and windings at nominal temperatures will run for decades.

---

## 8. **They’re hostages to their own firmware**

Every inverter is only as good as the code running it. Bugs, updates, vendor lock-in, cyber risks — all baked into the cake. You’re trusting your grid stability to an opaque box of FPGAs and DSP code you didn’t write, can’t audit, and can’t fix on-site. A synchronous generator’s “firmware” is a torque curve you can measure with a torque wrench.

---

## 9. **Grid operators know this — deep down**

Ask any veteran in system operations: when the chips are down, they want real machines with real inertia on their side. You can *see* the frequency trace behave differently when there’s a wall of steel and copper behind it instead of a thousand little digital boxes pretending to be machines.

---

## Bottom Line

Digital inverters are fine for feeding *energy* into a stable grid. But for **stability**, **inertia**, and **fault tolerance**, they will *always* lose to a physically coupled, mechanically limited synchronous machine like the TSGB.  
You can’t beat physics with firmware. You can’t program away latency, and you can’t fake a flywheel. The grid deserves real muscle, not digital theatre.

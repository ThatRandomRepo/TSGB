# Contributions Guide

## Purpose of this Repository
This project exists to present and discuss the **TSGB concept**:  
- Grid stability, synthetic/mechanical inertia, and control loops.  
- Supporting documents, simulations, and reference code.  
- A platform to **spark technical discussion**, not a finished product.  

The repository is **not** open source in the usual sense.  
See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for terms — all rights reserved.

## How You Can Contribute
Contributions are welcome in the form of:
- **Issues**: raise questions, challenge assumptions, or suggest improvements.  
- **Discussions**: comment on control strategies, safety considerations, black-start scenarios, SCADA/EMS integration, etc.  
- **Pull Requests (PRs)**:  
  - Small fixes (typos, clarity, readme/docs).  
  - Additions of non-commercial simulations or analysis that extend discussion.  
  - Notes on validation, test cases, or alternative approaches.

## Boundaries
- Do **not** attempt to contribute production-ready designs or commercial implementations here.  
- Do **not** submit proprietary or unsafe code.  
- This repo is for **conceptual, academic, and technical dialogue only**.  

---

## Code & Docs Standards
- Use **clear, simple code** (Python, C/C++, or other widely understood languages).  
- Keep simulations self-contained and documented with a short README.  
- Use **markdown** for notes, diagrams, or supporting arguments.  
- Be factual where possible; clearly mark opinions or assumptions.  

---

## Tone & Style
- Respect the author’s voice and intent — direct, factual, and unpolished is fine.  
- Strong opinions are allowed; personal attacks are not.  
- Keep discussions technical and constructive.  

---

## Safety Reminder
Some concepts described here involve **large rotating machinery** and **high-energy systems**.  
- Treat all materials as **theoretical**.  
- Do not attempt physical construction or deployment based on this repository.

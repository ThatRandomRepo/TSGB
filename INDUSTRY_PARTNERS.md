## TSGB Is Not Your Competitor — It's Your Anchor

Let’s be clear from the start:

**TSGB does not end your inverters.**  
**TSGB does not replace your systems.**  
**TSGB does not threaten your products.**

What it does is give everything else **room to breathe**.

## Inverters Thrive When the Grid Is Stable

Right now, we’re chasing instability with unstable tools.  
You know it. I know it. Everyone in power systems knows it.

- Low system inertia is making things twitchy  
- Grid events are more violent than they’ve ever been  
- The RoCoF spikes are beyond what most systems were designed for  
- And we’re trying to **simulate stability**, not create it

## TSGB Is Different

TSGB doesn’t fake inertia — it **makes** it.

- Real rotating mass  
- Controlled torque response  
- Preloaded lean-in mechanics  
- No software smoothing, no time delays, no estimations

TSGB brings a mechanical backbone to a digital nervous system.

## A Quick Word on Tone

If you’ve read the white paper, you might have felt a few jabs.  
Yeah — some of the language toward inverter tech was sharp. Maybe unfair.  
But the frustration wasn’t with the engineering — it was with the context.

**In today’s conditions**, your products struggle.  
That’s not entirely your fault — you’ve been handed chaos and asked to tame it with math.

TSGB isn’t here to take your thunder. It’s here to **hand it back to you with a clear sky**.

What you’ve built is incredible.  
With inertial support, your systems aren’t just better — they can become **magnificent**.

## Inverters + TSGB = The Right Mix

When TSGB smooths the RoCoF, your inverters operate better:
- Less overshoot
- Fewer false triggers
- Smoother handoff between systems
- More predictability for advanced control logic

TSGB becomes the **anchor in a storm** — not the hero, not the centerpiece, but the thing that lets everything else *work as designed*.

## Collaborate, Don’t Compete

You’ve already got incredible tech.  
You’ve built converters, storage, balancing, prediction, orchestration.

TSGB **wants to work with it all** — to lower the baseline chaos that makes your job harder.

- Want to test it? Let’s talk.  
- Want to critique it? Please do.  
- Want to simulate it? You’ve got the models.  
- Want to see if it breaks? That’s how we make it better.

This isn’t a pitch — it’s a challenge.

## Final Thought

TSGB isn’t trying to take your place.  
It’s trying to *make your place more survivable*.

So if you’ve got simulation tools, real-time test rigs, grid modeling setups — or just strong opinions — I’m here.

Open an issue. Call out the flaws. Add your thoughts.  
But don’t ignore it just because it didn’t come from inside the room.

# Privacy Policy (Plain-English)

**Effective date:** 29 August 2025

> **Short version:** We aren’t interested in your data. Anything collected is only what’s needed to run this service in the moment, and it expires when your visit ends. We don’t look at it, we don’t use it, and we don’t need it.

---

## Who we are

This policy covers the custom GPT provided by **\[Your Name/Company]** (“we”, “us”, “our”).

## What we collect (session-only, minimal)

To make the GPT work while you’re using it, the service briefly handles:

* **Your prompt & the model’s response** (so the model can reply).
* **Basic technical metadata** like IP address and user agent, strictly for delivery and security while the session is active.

We **do not** deliberately collect analytics, marketing identifiers, or tracking profiles.

## How we use your data

* **Only to provide the service you ask for** in real time.
* **No human review** of your prompts or outputs.
* **No selling, sharing, or profiling.**

## How long we keep it (we don’t)

* **Session data expires when you leave/end your visit.**
* Temporary technical logs (if any exist at all) are purged automatically and are not used for any other purpose.

## Third parties & model providers

This GPT may run on infrastructure and models provided by **OpenAI** (or a similar model provider) and standard hosting providers. While our intent and configuration are “no retention beyond the session,” these providers inevitably **process** prompts to return answers. Please review the provider’s own privacy policy and terms, as their systems and retention settings may apply at the platform level.

* We do not enable any optional data-sharing features.
* We do not use your prompts to train our own models.

## Cookies

* We don’t set tracking cookies.
* Any platform-level cookies (e.g., from OpenAI or your browser) are controlled by that platform/browser.

## Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data while it’s in transit during your session.

## Your rights (EU/UK)

If you’re in the EU/UK, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data. Since we don’t retain data beyond your visit, there’s typically nothing to access or erase—but you can still contact us if you have questions.

You can also raise concerns with your local authority (e.g., the UK ICO).

## Children

This service is not intended for children under 13 (or the applicable age in your region).

## Changes

If we materially change this policy, we’ll update the “Effective date” above. We’ll keep the same principle: **we aren’t interested in your data.**

## Contact

Questions? Email **\[contact\@email.example]** or write to **\[Postal Address, City, Country]**.

### Plain-English Promise

* We don’t look at your data.
* We don’t use your data beyond serving your request.
* We don’t need your data after your visit—so we don’t keep it

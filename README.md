# TSGB — Twin Scroll Grid Balancer  
### A Mechanical Inertia System for the Modern Grid

---

## ⚠️ PLEASE READ FIRST

This repository is **not a product**, **not an open-source tool**, and **not for commercial use**.  
It is **my work**, shared in good faith — to **spark conversation**, **provoke engineering debate**, and invite **critical engagement**.

I’ve sent this to over a thousand inboxes. I’ve received no replies.  
So now, I publish it publicly — **intentionally incomplete**, **intentionally dangerous if misused**, but unmistakably serious.

## 🧠 What This Is

TSGB (Twin Scroll Grid Balancer) is a fully mechanical approach to grid inertia using torque control, real rotating mass, and gear logic.  
It is designed to inject real, physical inertia into a falling grid — without power electronics or software emulation.

It’s a system that **feels** the grid.  
It leans in. It downshifts. It balances. It fights.

And I didn’t get this from a classroom — I lived it.  
The shed, the mistakes, the hole in the wall — they’re all part of this paper.

## 💬 How to Engage

Want to ask a question? **Open an issue**.  
Want to challenge the logic? **Cite the code or the sim**.  
Want to work with me or support this? **Let’s talk through GitHub first**.

I will defend the idea. I will debate with engineers.  
This is not just a prototype — it’s a personal project that’s consumed over a year of my life.

## 📂 What’s In This Repo

This repository is more than a whitepaper. It’s more than an idea.

It includes:

- 📄 **White Paper** — The full TSGB concept, logic, engineering intent, and design rationale
- 🧠 **Control Logic** — C++ examples of gear selection, anti-hunting, and preloaded response
- 🧪 **Simulators**:
  - Python simulator showing how torque and gear shift respond to RoCoF
  - Embedded-style C code for microcontroller control loops
  - Web-based demo you can open in a browser
  - CSV-logging test suite with verification logic
  - Smooth real-time sim showing lean-in torque logic over 6 seconds
- 📘 READMEs for each — to help you follow, but not replicate
- ⚠️ Gaps and omissions — **on purpose**, because I’ve learned the dangers of sharing too much

## ❌ What This Is Not

- ❌ This is NOT free to use
- ❌ This is NOT open source
- ❌ This is NOT safe to build from the current state
- ❌ This is NOT a commercial deployment guide
- ❌ This is NOT licensed under any standard license

## 🔒 Why It’s Deliberately Incomplete

Because you **should not** try to build this without the context.  
- There are **critical elements** held back
- There are **dangerous resonance risks** with grid synchronization
- You need to understand the **torque preload principle**, **RoCoF response**, and **dwell time handling**

This repo **cannot be built safely** without deeper knowledge.  
But if you're serious, curious, and want to **engage thoughtfully**, I’m open.

## 💰 Money?

If this earns something, I won’t complain.  
But this isn’t about money.

This is about the **possibility** that 100% renewable penetration **can** be achieved, with real inertia, and mechanical simplicity.  
That we don't need to fake physics — we can build with them.

## 🚨 Final Note

> **I don’t recommend building from this.**  
> If you try to replicate this blindly, **you could seriously hurt yourself**, damage property, or destabilize a grid.  
> Without the missing math, the preload logic, the calibration methods, and physical constraints, **this is an incomplete toolset**.

This work is published to provoke thought, not to deploy recklessly.

If you want to go deeper, **go slower**.  
I already did the legwork. Now it’s your turn to understand the problem — **then** the solution.
